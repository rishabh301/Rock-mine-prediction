🏗️ Rock-Mine Prediction using Machine Learning

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting whether an object is a rock or a mine using machine learning techniques. It is based on Sonar signal data, where different frequency signals are used to classify underwater objects. The dataset contains features derived from sonar returns bounced off objects, helping in classification.

🎯 Objectives

Develop an ML model to classify objects as Rock or Mine.
Perform data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation.
Compare different machine learning algorithms to find the best-performing model.
Deploy the trained model for real-time predictions.

📂 Dataset Information
